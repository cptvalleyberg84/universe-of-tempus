# Intro

**Project Description**

A website dedicated to discovering a science-fiction novel - THE AGE OF NEW ERA. Website will serve as a platform to learn more of what the novel is about. Of course it will merely mindly put on the track, but according to me - the less you know - the more you will enjoy - so just give it a shot and might be you will find interest in the whole story. Over the years of trying to market the novel - I found out that it is very difficult for me to talk about it, so I figured this proejct could be a perfect solution. From one hand it's an innovative approach to a book marketing, from the other hand - it's fun and games, and you can WIN a code for a free audiobook or e-book! Isn't that cool?

**Purpose**

The main purpose of this website is to create an engaging website which will possible rise interest about the novel.

+ **Miscellaneous**

    + Additionally, all anchor links are Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) with aria-labels to enhance accessibility, especially important as my novel is also available in audiobook format.

## Features Left to Implement
At the beginning I thought it would be fun to have also the progress reader function, but it felt over scoped and I think to implement it in the later stages of publishing this website.
I also thought it would be good to connect it with more information about where users can get the novel, but also - it is just a fun game page, so that's not the place for it - but maybe later.

# Design

## **Color Palette**
+ I used very subtle coloring making it easy to identify the parts of the website.
    + The Header and the Footer of the site is in the same dark color with light colored text and icons
    + for the background I have used the logo from the book cover with edited out author name and the title of the book, which together builds a great background texture.
    + the sections have lightly transparent white background with nice framing around the sections.

## **Typography**
+ For the text font I used the same font as users will be able to find inside the novel paper book or e-book version to keep them familiarized with the style
    + Font is Libre Caslon Text, Serif

## **Design Inspiration**
+ The design of the site meets needs of the functionality of the website. It's suppose to be easy to understand what there is on the website, easy to find and be clear for visibility. The website has a header and a footer, and the main section is build of 2 corespondent interactive javascript elements.

+ **Bugs**
    + No significant bugs have been identified. Minor adjsutments were made to improve performance and user experience. 

I had mutliple issues: (not mentioning how complex and big the Javascript seems to be. Amazing possibilities for building creations - which I still have to discover)

### In the map section: 
Floating points where all over the place for most part of project building. not responsive - the issue laid with overflow, width control, and relative position in the container of the dots.

### In the quiz section: 
Multiple issues with logic, and how it is all done. It's more than one can figure out straight from the box. Putting everything together has been quite difficult, and even thou near the end, I had some issues with buttons being hidden while should not, or not working while they should. It is worth to note that issue sometimes exist outside of javascript and merely one display:none in CSS, may bring lots of confusion. Its important to logically understand that display:none can be assigned also to various id's or classes, and it's worth to remember which ones. - otherwise - if a button does not work - it is good to go through the code, again and again until understanding will come. in this case - going from the top and following each variable, checking everywhere it exists for the slightest error may bring a lot of happiness.
But when you do, and it's not midnight - it can even bring a smile - that this day, was not all for errors, but also for solutions. (18-07-2024)

new issue arising: if I need to have the quiz questions always on the same height? - if so - I couldn't yet figure out how to do so. I tried placing a placholder image, and different JS for replacing it, but so far it was always the same result - answers moving up or down, between the questions.

The restart button story.

The responsive quiz section story. - building responsive design, especially with the menu met with few difficulties, but all where solved after finding the "all: unset;" property and building it again from scratch.

the green dot on hover for some reason stays green until you will choose the next dot, but only on small screens, not the big screens? when I change in the inspector to emulation of mobiles - regarding of the size it stays green - but when I click the PC emulation it disappears -  it also works like this on a few phones. 

# Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

# Special Thanks

Thank you to the Code Institute Javascript Essentials course - it was greatly full of theory. Practice comes hard! Javascript is not easy to begin with.

Would love to say thank you to the CI Tutor team for the help with confusion about the RESTART Button, their guidance finally led me to solution after I struggled for about 2 days.

Big **THANK YOU** to my amazing Mentor Juliia_Konn for guidence and additional tips and tricks!
