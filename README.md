## Bugs section
I had mutliple issues: (not mentioning how complex and big the Javascript seems to be. Amazing possibilities for building creations - which I still have to discover)
### In the map section: 
Floating points where all over the place for most part of project building. not responsive - the issue laid with overflow, width control, and relative position in the container of the dots.

### In the quiz section: 
Multiple issues with logic, and how it is all done. It's more than one can figure out straight from the box. Putting everything together has been quite difficult, and even thou near the end, I had some issues with buttons being hidden while should not, or not working while they should. It is worth to note that issue sometimes exist outside of javascript and merely one display:none in CSS, may bring lots of confusion. Its important to logically understand that display:none can be assigned also to various id's or classes, and it's worth to remember which ones. - otherwise - if a button does not work - it is good to go through the code, again and again until understanding will come. in this case - going from the top and following each variable, checking everywhere it exists for the slightest error may bring a lot of happiness.
But when you do, and it's not midnight - it can even bring a smile - that this day, was not all for errors, but also for solutions. (18-07-2024)

new issue arising: if I need to have the quiz questions always on the same height? - if so - I couldn't yet figure out how to do so. I tried placing a placholder image, and different JS for replacing it, but so far it was always the same result - answers moving up or down, between the questions.
